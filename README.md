# Tweeter Project

## Welcome to Tweeter, a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository contains forked code from Lighthouse Lab, which was then built upon using HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX to display my front-end skills. Back-end skills include Node and Express.

## Getting Started

1. [Create](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) a new repository using this repository as a template.
2. Clone your repository onto your local device.
3. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
4. Start the web server using the `npm start` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
